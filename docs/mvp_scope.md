# MVP Scope Definition

## Document Count Target

**MVP Target: 300–500 documents**

This target balances comprehensive coverage with project feasibility for a term-long academic project.

## Source Type Distribution

| Source Type | Target Count | Priority | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|----------|-------|
| SEC Filings (10-K, 10-Q) | 40–50 | High | ~4 per year (2015–present) |
| SEC Filings (8-K) | 50–80 | Medium | Major announcements only |
| Earnings Call Transcripts | 40–50 | High | Quarterly calls (2015–present) |
| Press Releases | 80–120 | High | AI/product-related releases |
| Corporate Blog Posts | 50–80 | Medium | Technology and product blogs |
| Public Media Articles | 50–100 | Low | Major coverage only |

## Temporal Distribution

Documents should be distributed across the analysis period to ensure:

- **Minimum per year**: 15 documents (2015–2024)
- **Quarterly coverage**: At least 1 document per quarter where available
- **Recent emphasis**: Higher density for 2020–present (AI acceleration period)

## Source Priority

### Tier 1 (Must Have)
- All 10-K and 10-Q filings (2015–present)
- All earnings call transcripts (public sources)

### Tier 2 (Should Have)
- Material 8-K filings
- AI-focused blog posts
- Investor day presentations

### Tier 3 (Nice to Have)

- Media coverage
- Industry analyst commentary (public only)

## Quality Thresholds

3. **Machine-readable** text extractable
4. **Dated** with clear publication timestamp
5. **Relevant** to AI, products, capabilities, or risk disclosures

## Stretch Goals

If time permits:
- Expand to 600+ documents

- [ ] 300+ documents ingested and processed
